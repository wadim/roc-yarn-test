# roc-yarn-test

This repo was created to demonstrate that I cannot use `roc` with `yarn`.

### Let's run it with `npm` first:

```
npm install
roc dev
```

### I get:

```
Found a local version of Roc, will use that over the global one.

```

Everything looks good. Works as expected.

### Let's see what happens when I switch to `yarn`:

```
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
```

### I get:

```
$ roc dev

  There was a mismatch in the application configuration structure, make sure this is correct.

```

### This is my global configuration:

```
$ which roc
/Users/wadim/.nvm/versions/node/v6.7.0/bin/roc
$ roc --version
1.0.0-rc.10
```

### Clone this repo to reproduce

This is a fresh new app from the `web-app-react` template.

The only thing I changed in the repo (with respect to the code generated from the template) is:
 - Updated `roc-package-web-app-react` to `1.0.0-beta.9`
 - Updated `roc-package-web-app-react-dev` to `1.0.0-beta.9`
 - Updated `roc-plugin-style-sass` to `1.0.0-beta.4`
 - Added `.babelrc` with `{ "presets": ["es2015", "es2016", "es2017", "stage-0"] }` because it refused to work without it
